# Riggetti Assignment

Internal Software Team Take Home Challenge

## Installation

Anaconda:
Create a new python 3.8 environment:  

conda create --name casstest python=3.8  

Then install the following packages:  
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab  
conda install -c conda-forge lmfit  
conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib  

To use the gui you need to install ipywidgets:  
conda install -c conda-forge ipywidgets  

ipywidgets might not work with jupyterlab. But they should work with jupyter notebook  

Then clone the repository:  
git clone https://github.com/cassberk/RigettiHW  

type:  
jupyter notebook  
or  
jupyter lab  

Open the notebook...
